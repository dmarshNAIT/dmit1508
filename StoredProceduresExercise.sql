--1.	Create a stored procedure called “HonorCourses” to select all the course names that have averages >80%. 

--2.	Create a stored procedure called “HonorCoursesOneTerm” to select all the course names that have average >80% in semester A100.

--3.	Oops, made a mistake! For question 2, it should have been for semester A200. Write the code to change the procedure accordingly. 

--4.	Create a stored procedure called “NotInDMIT221” that lists the full names of the staff that have not taught DMIT221.

--5.	Create a stored procedure called “LowNumbers” to select the course name of the course(s) that have had the lowest number of students in it. Assume all courses have registrations.

--6.	Create a stored procedure called “Provinces” to list all the students' provinces.

--7.	OK, question 6 was ridiculously simple and serves no purpose. Lets remove that stored procedure from the database.

--8.	Create a stored procedure called StudentPaymentTypes that lists all the student names and their payment type Description. Ensure all the student names are listed.

--9.	Modify the procedure from question 8 to return only the student names that have made payments.
